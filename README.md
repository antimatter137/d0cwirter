have ai write google docs like a human!

# To use
go to your google doc, open dev tools for whatever browser you're on, and paste it in. then paste in what you want typed in so your teachers dont see big copy and pastes, then select your typo probability (0-1), choose something low like .02 or .03, and select your speed (medium by default, this is the best one). Lastly, profit!!!
